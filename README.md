**Abstract**

Positive-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales have the largest known RNA genomes of vertebrate and invertebrate viruses with 36.7 
and 41.1 kb, respectively. The acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) by an ancestral nidovirus enabled crossing of the 20 kb 
barrier. Other factors constraining genome expansions in nidoviruses remain poorly defined. Here, we assemble 76 genome sequences of invertebrate 
nidoviruses from >500.000 published transcriptome experiments and triple the number of known nidoviruses with >36 kb genomes, including the 
largest known 64 kb RNA genome. Many of the novel viral lineages acquired putative enzymatic domains that were inserted in ORF1a and ORF1b 
and may constitute cofactors of viral replication or modulate infection otherwise. We classify ExoN-encoding nidoviruses into seven groups 
and four subgroups, according to canonical and non-canonical modes of viral replicase expression by ribosomes and genomic organization (reModes). 
The most-represented group employing the canonical reMode comprises invertebrate and vertebrate nidoviruses, including coronaviruses. Six groups 
with non-canonical reModes include invertebrate nidoviruses with 31-to-64 kb genomes. Among them are viruses with segmented genomes and viruses 
utilizing dual ribosomal frameshifting that we validate experimentally. Moreover, largest polyprotein length and genome size in nidoviruses show 
reMode- and host phylum-dependent relationships. We demonstrate that the largest polyproteins in nidoviruses may be close to an upper size limit 
that we hypothesize to be determined by the host-inherent translation fidelity, ultimately setting a nidovirus genome size limit. Thus, expansion 
of ExoN-encoding RNA virus genomes, the vertebrate/invertebrate host division, the control of viral replicase expression, and translation fidelity 
are interconnected in nidoviruses.
